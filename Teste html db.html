<p>Obsidian Publish™ is a paid hosting service for your notes.</p>
<p>For instructions on how to publish your notes from within the Obsidian app, refer to the [[5. Notas/Obsidiandb/Plugins/Publish|Publish plugin]].</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>You have total control over what to publish via the [[5. Notas/Obsidiandb/Plugins/Publish|Publish plugin]] - either your entire vault or just selected notes within your vault. As for any notes you choose <strong>not</strong> to publish, you can be confident that those notes remain completely private, and Obsidian Publish has no knowledge of them.</p>
<h3 id="backing-up">Backing up</h3>
<p>Please note that Obsidian Publish is not to be used as a backup for your content. Make sure you always have a personal backup copy of your site using your preferred backup method. Our efforts on Obsidian Publish will be more focused on functionality, ease of use, and site availability.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-included">What&#39;s included</h3>
<p>The Obsidian Publish service lets you create your site directly from within the Obsidian app by choosing the notes you want to publish.</p>
<p>To customize your site, you can choose between light and dark mode, and also toggle between readable line length and full page length.</p>
<p>There are several components which can be turned on or off from the [[5. Notas/Obsidiandb/Plugins/Publish|Publish plugin]]. Changes to these options will be reflected on your published site once the cache clears, typically within 5 minutes.</p>
<h5 id="navigation">Navigation</h5>
<p>Enabling this option adds a navigation sidebar displaying all published pages and the folders that contain them. Viewers will see the current open note highlighted, and can click on any other note to navigate.</p>
<h5 id="graph-view">Graph view</h5>
<p>Displays a local graph of the page currently open. This uses the same rendering engine as the [[5. Notas/Obsidiandb/Plugins/Graph view]] plugin in Obsidian.</p>
<h5 id="table-of-contents">Table of contents</h5>
<p>Displays a table of contents for the page currently open. The list is generated from headings within the page, similar to the [[5. Notas/Obsidiandb/Plugins/Outline]] plugin. Viewers navigating the note will see the corresponding heading highlighted as they scroll, and can click on another heading to immediately navigate to it.</p>
<h5 id="hover-preview">Hover preview</h5>
<p>When hovering over links, their content is displayed within a popup box. This works similarly to the [[5. Notas/Obsidiandb/Plugins/Page preview]] plugin in Obsidian.</p>
<h5 id="backlinks">Backlinks</h5>
<p>Displays a section at the end of each page called &quot;Linked to this page&quot;, containing backlinks from other pages. If there are no backlinks, the section will not be displayed.</p>
<h5 id="custom-css">Custom CSS</h5>
<p>To customize the styling of your site, you can upload either <code>obsidian.css</code> or <code>publish.css</code>. These files must be stored in the root folder of your site. You can also upload both so you can use your existing <code>obsidian.css</code> and add some extra tweaks for publish in <code>publish.css</code>.</p>
<h5 id="favicon">Favicon</h5>
<p>To change the favicon of your site, you can upload <code>png</code> icons of any size in the format of <code>favicon-32.png</code> or <code>favicon-32x32.png</code>. You can also upload the file <code>favicon.ico</code>. These files can be stored in any folder. The current recommendation (as of 2020) is to provide sizes <code>32×32</code>, <code>128x128</code>, <code>152×152</code>, <code>167x167</code>, <code>180x180</code>, <code>192x192</code>, and <code>196x196</code>.</p>

<h3 id="technical-details">Technical details</h3>
<p>Obsidian Publish uses Cloudflare as the CDN (content delivery network) to distribute your site across the globe for a faster access. This involves caching copies of the files of your site on some of the 200+ data centers to ensure the lowest latency for your readers and the site remain speedy and loads fast even if your viewer lives far away from our primary servers.</p>
<p>However, this does mean that when you change site settings, publish new content, or unpublish content, visitors might not see the latest version for a short while. Currently, our cache is configured to persist for an hour before it has to be &quot;re-validated&quot; to ensure the content hasn&#39;t changed.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve just published items but you are still seeing an older version, you can typically perform a &quot;hard refresh&quot; by holding the reload button and choosing &quot;Hard reload&quot; in the dropdown menu. Failing that, you can try clearing the browser cache or disabling cache using the developer tools in the network tab.</p>
